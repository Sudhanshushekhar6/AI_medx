# **AI for Diagnosis & Early Detection**

## **Overview**
This AI-powered healthcare system detects multiple diseases, including **dental diseases, heart conditions, and brain tumors**, using medical imaging and structured patient data. The model provides **accurate diagnosis and personalized recommendations**, improving early detection and healthcare accessibility.

## **Problem Statement**
● **Late diagnosis** leads to severe health risks.  
● **Limited accessibility** to expert radiologists and specialists.  
● **High misdiagnosis rates** due to human error.  
● **Manual analysis** of medical reports is time-consuming.  
● **Lack of AI-driven solutions** to assist healthcare professionals.  

## **Data Collection & Preprocessing**
### **Data Sources**
- **Dental Disease Data:** [ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340924009326)  
- **Heart Disease Data:** Kaggle – Patient symptoms, ECG, cholesterol, etc.  
- **Brain Tumor Data:** Kaggle – MRI scans with tumor classification  

### **Preprocessing Steps**
● **Image Processing:** Contrast enhancement, noise removal, resizing.  
● **Feature Extraction:** Edge detection, segmentation, texture analysis.  
● **Heart Disease Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, encoding.  
● **Normalization & Augmentation:** Rotation, flipping, zooming.  

## **Model & Methodology**
● **Deep Learning Models:** CNNs for medical images, ML models for structured data.  
● **Disease Classification:** Predicts **BDC-BDR, Caries, Fractured Teeth, Healthy Teeth, Impacted Teeth, Infection**, Heart Disease, and Brain Tumor stages.  
● **Recommendation System:** Provides personalized treatment suggestions.  

## **Real-World Impact**
● **Early Detection** – Reduces severe health risks.  
● **Higher Accuracy** – Minimizes misdiagnosis.  
● **Faster Diagnosis** – Automates medical analysis.  
● **Better Accessibility** – Helps underserved regions.  
● **Cost-Effective** – Lowers healthcare costs.  
● **Scalable Solution** – Can extend to more diseases.
